# Hybrid Search Langchain

## Overview
This project implements a **hybrid search mechanism** leveraging LangChain, a powerful framework for creating applications powered by large language models (LLMs). The solution integrates multiple retrieval techniques to enhance search precision and efficiency, making it suitable for applications like information retrieval, document search, and conversational AI.

## Features
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines semantic search with traditional keyword-based search for improved accuracy.
- **LangChain Integration**: Utilizes LangChain for seamless integration with language models.
- **Customizable Pipelines**: Modular design allows for easy adjustments and scalability.
- **Interactive Outputs**: Provides clear and actionable insights based on user queries.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8 or later.
2. Install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0Xuser100/End-To-End-Hubrid-Search-Rag-With-Pinecone-db-And-Langchain.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd  End-To-End-Hubrid-Search-Rag-With-Pinecone-db-And-Langchain
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Project
1. Launch the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. Open the Streamlit app in your browser to interact with the hybrid search functionality.

### Example Query
Enter a query such as:
```
Find relevant documents about climate change.
```
The system will provide results combining keyword matching and semantic relevance.

## Results
The project demonstrates:
- Enhanced search accuracy through hybrid techniques.
- Efficient retrieval of contextually relevant documents.
- Scalable design for integration into larger applications.

## Future Work
- Integration with additional LLMs for advanced capabilities.
- Optimization for large-scale datasets.
- Deployment as a cloud-hosted service for real-time use.
